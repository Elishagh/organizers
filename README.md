# Organizers

If you are an existing organizer, or intend to become one in the future **please read and abide by our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md)**.

## How to start a new Connected Devices chapter

**First, open an issue on this repo asking to get added as a chapter organizer**

Your issue should say something like this (not everything is required but it's nice to tell us a little about yourself so you don't come across as a total stranger):

> Hi, I would like to start a chapter for [name of geographic community]. I am [@your twitter name] on twitter and work at/on <name of company or project>. I will be co-organizing this chapter with [names of other organizers].

The chapter name should preferably be the name of the city, where the events will
be held. Alternatively the area should be small, but yet meaningful, e.g `princeton` instead of
`new-jersey` or `usa`. Also the repo name should be short and all lowercase.

**An existing Owner will have to respond and create your Chapter repository for you**

Once you are an organizer follow these instructions to set up your chapter:

### Step 1

You should have been added to the team called `chapter-organizers` and should have access to edit the new chapter repo, e.g. https://github.com/connected-devices/sanfrancisco

### Step 2

Each chapter can set up their own `gh-pages` branch on their org and GitHub pages will automatically route `connected-devices.github.io/<reponame>` to it

You should create a code of conduct for your website and repository. You can use 
[this template](codeofconduct-template.md) as a starting point. Make sure to make
all people feel welcome at your event.

Another bonus feature is that you can simply use `gitter.im/connected-devices/<chaptername>` to automatically get a chat room for your chapter.

That's all the mandatory steps. Here are some optional steps:

### Benefits of this approach

- chapters get their own "mailing list" (GitHub issues). These can be in other languages as well, e.g. Spanish for Latin-American Chapters, whereas the main Discuss repo is primarily in English
- chapters get their own website
- since all chapter members are open open source style contributors, it means everyone gets empowered to help moderate discussions and improve the chapter website
